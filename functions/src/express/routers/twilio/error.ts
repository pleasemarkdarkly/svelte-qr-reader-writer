We cannot guarantee message delivery on devices roaming off-network.\r\n*  Can the device receive non-Twilio SMS?\r\n*  Can the device receive messages from another Twilio number (non-Alphanumeric Sender ID), or with a shorter one-segment (non-concatenated) body?\r\n*  Can other devices using the same mobile carrier receive your messages?\r\n\r\nIf you can rule out all of the above issues, continue troubleshooting below.\r\n\r\n#### Messages sent from short codes\r\nRepeated Error 30003 results on undelivered messages sent from [short codes](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223182068-What-is-a-Messaging-Short-Code) could occur if the destination user has a wireless plan that does not support short code or \"Premium\" messages.\r\n\r\nTo workaround these plan limitations, we suggest using the **Fallback to Long Code** feature of [Messaging CoPilot](https://www.twilio.com/copilot). By enabling this feature, CoPilot will attempt first to send your message out using your short code, and then make a second attempt over a [long code](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-long-code-phone-number) if necessary. For more details, please see our blog post [\"Improve SMS Deliverability with Fallback to Long Code\"](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/06/improve-sms-deliverability-with-fallback-to-long-code.html).\r\n\r\n**Sprint** customers may be able to allow messages sent from your short code by texting the phrase `Allow XXXXX` to **9999**, replacing `XXXXX` with your short code. However, customers from other wireless carriers will likely need to reach out to their carrier's support group to enable \"Premium\" or short code messaging.\r\n\r\n#### Messages sent from long codes\r\nRepeated Error 30003 results on undelivered messages sent from long codes (regular phone numbers) could be due to carrier filtering. \r\n\r\nThe rules for carrier filtering vary throughout the industry, making it difficult at times to pin down exactly why a message is being filtered out. For more details including potential workarounds, please see this Help Center article [\"How Does Carrier Filtering Work?\"](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223181848-How-Does-Carrier-Filtering-Work)\r\n\r\n#### Continued Error 30003 issues\r\nTwilio's Support team can help investigate what went wrong with delivering your message. Please collect 3 or more message SIDs in your [SMS logs](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/logs) from the last 24 hours that were flagged with Error 30003, and [open a support request](https://www.twilio.com/console/support/tickets/create).", "description": null, "product": "Programmable SMS", "date_created": "2016-03-31T17:14:34Z", "last_updated": "2020-08-04T10:00:24.586Z" },
